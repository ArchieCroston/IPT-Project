		<H1 ID="Question-1" class="offset">1. Provide three methods by which a user could verify the accuracy of information located on the Internet. </H1>

		<p>There are various methods of verifying the accuracy and validity of information located on the internet. These methods can be conducted to ensure that information used on the Internet is reliable and comes from a reputable and knowledgeable source. The first method is to make an attempt at discovering who the author of the page is. After doing this, research more about the author and his/her background, by finding out things like previous information published, their education and their reputability. The second method is to compare the information to other websites that have similar information published on them. By doing this, you can assume that the information is true as the same information appears on many different websites that have different authors. The third method is to look at the domain name. Websites that have domain names that end in either .edu or .gov can only be used by the government or educational institutions. If the website ends in .com, or .net, the information could be coming from anyone or anywhere. Unless two other methods have been used to guarantee this information, these websites should not be relied on.
		</p>
		<p>By using these methods in conjunction with each other, you can safely guarantee with some certainty that the information you find in websites is <a id="Question-2"></a>reliable, and comes from a trustworthy organisation or author. Failure to use these methods could lead to false information being used or relied on. 
		</p>
		<H1>2. What is the difference between a primary and a secondary source of data? </H1>
		<p>The fundamental difference between primary and secondary data is its source. Primary data is data that a researcher or observer has collected and presented themselves. This data is unique and new original information. Secondary data is data that is collected and presented from pre-existing information or research. Secondary data is not original, and is based by research or observations made by others. As a result of this, secondary data is less reliable then primary data, as it is not original<a id="Question-3"></a> information. Secondary data could be altered to fit other purposes or objectives, whereas primary data is collected purely for a fixed objective. For this reason, primary data should be used over secondary data in most cases. 
		</p>
		<H1>3. List three methods of making data transfer via the internet more secure. </H1>
		<p>Data transfer through the internet can be made more secure through a variety of different ways. One of the easiest and most efficient ways of protecting data during transfer is a firewall. Throughout the duration of a transfer, a firewall would stop unauthorised devices from accessing the network and stealing the data from within the network, before it even reaches the Internet. It is also important to encrypt your data during transfer. Many routers and programs encrypt data, so that nobody can access it whilst it is reaching its destination. Having encrypted data also means that only the true recipient of the data can receive it, that being anyone with the encryption key. A third method of securing data transfer on the internet is to use a secure protocol when transferring data or information such as FTP. FTP is a standard network protocol used in the transfer of files between a client<a id="Question-4"></a> and a server. This means that only the people with access to the server can access the data, which is securely encrypted.

		<H1>4. Explain the term <font face="verdana">"</font>netiquette<font face="verdana">"</font>. </H1>
		<p>Netiquette stands for network etiquette, and is a set of rules established by internet users that act as a set of social conventions that guide communication over the Internet. These rules are the <q>do's and dont's</q> of the Internet, and the administrators of most websites<a id="Question-5"></a> encourage the use and enforcement of these rules to keep the Internet safe and enjoyable as well as free of harassment and bullying,
		</p>
		<H1>5. What three facts should be included in a list of sources when acknowledging information obtained from a website? </H1>
		<p>There are three important facts that should be included when referencing a website in a bibliography. The first is the author of the webpage. This should be included so the author receives the proper recognition of the work they made available on their webpage. The second is when the webpage was accessed. The date should be included so that any inconsistencies on the website can be attributed to the website being changed since the date. The final piece of information that should be included is the URL of the website. The URL should be included so that markers or other people can find the true location of the source that was used in the publication. <a id="Question-6"></a>All of these should be included in a citation to allow people to properly find the true sources of information in your work, and the information regarding the use of these sources.
		</p>
		<H1>6. Name two ways in which the use of the internet has changed the way in which people work. </H1>
		<p>The introduction of the Internet in the workplace has changed the ways in which many people work across the globe. Many jobs have been created and lost as a result of the Internet. However, most jobs have changed as a direct result of the Internet. For example, many people no longer travel to work daily, and choose to work at home instead, allowing them to generate an income without leaving their home, or at least not often. <a id="Question-7"></a>The Internet has also created many jobs. It is now many peoples jobs to maintain websites, interact with customers, run social media websites, and more, all for the companies they work for.
		</p>
		<H1>7. Explain TCP/IP and FTP. </H1>
		<H3>TCP/IP</H3>
		<p>TCP/IP is the transmission protocol of the Internet, and can also be used as a communications protocol for a private network. It deals with the communication between computers and a network. When connected directly to the Internet, your computer is able to send and receive information using the protocol, to and from servers. This is because TCP/IP is a client/server model of communication, where client computers download information from the server e.g. downloading a web page. This protocol also handles the address of each information, so that the information sent by both sides of the network get to the right destination.
		</p>
		<H3>FTP</H3>
		<p>FTP is also a network protocol like TCP/IP, however, they differ in that FTP servers operate on a closed computer network, and are used to coordinate file transfers between computers. Like TCP/IP, FTP is also a client/server protocol, allowing client computers to download information from a server. FTP is almost exclusively used to transfer files and does not deal with routing the information to an address, where it uses TCP instead to open a connection between the two<a id="Bibliography"></a> computers.
